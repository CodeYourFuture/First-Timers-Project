# First Timers: Open Source

<details>
<summary>What is Open Source?</summary>
Open Source Software (OSS) means anyone can look at the "source code", use it, and change it. It's a way of sharing software that allows people to collaborate and build on each other's work. OSS is a great way to learn how to code, because you can see how other people have solved problems. You can also contribute to OSS projects, which is a smart way to get experience and build your portfolio.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Is everything Open Source?</summary>
No. There's plenty of software that isn't Open Source. For example, you can see the source code for Android, but you can't see the source code for iOS.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Does Open Source mean free?</summary>

[No](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source).

OSS is licensed, which means that you can use it, but you can't use it in a way that breaks the license. Our Syllabus is [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/), which means other schools can (and do) copy the content and use it in their own courses, but they can't sell it and they have to say where the content came from.

You do have to [check the rules](https://opensource.org/licenses/) before using Open Source software in commercial projects. (Most Open Source software is licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), which allows commercial use.)

<summary>Almost everything you use in your daily life as a developer is Open Source.</summary>

### The gang's all here:

- Here's Facebook on GitHub: https://github.com/facebook
- Here's Apple https://github.com/apple
- Here's Google https://github.com/google
- Here's Twitter https://github.com/twitter
- Here's Amazon https://github.com/aws

_Every major tech company develops Open Source projects_. They're all here on GitHub. Most major governments have OSS too. Here's the [UK government on Github](https://github.com/alphagov).

Here's the source for [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and here's [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node). Here's the source for the engine that implements [JavaScript](https://github.com/v8/v8) inside Chrome.

Here's the source for [MDN](https://github.com/mdn/content) that we make you look up all the time. And for [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), the editor you're using right now.

Here's the source code for the Linux operating system: https://github.com/torvalds/linux

Notice how that's someone's personal GitHub account? That's because Linux started out as a personal project; it was _made by that person_, Linus Torvalds. He's right here on Github too. This is where tech _lives_. And you are a part of it now. You can contribute to it. You can make it better.

You can make it yours.

This is the power and the opportunity of Open Source. You don't actually need credentials, or experience or a fancy education or a job to participate in Open Source. Your _code_ is what is evaluated in this world. If your Pull Request is clear and useful enough to others, it will be merged. If it's not, it won't.

OSS isn't a perfect world of fairness and impartiality - it's still made by imperfect human beans - but it's an _open_ world, and this opportunity is powerful.

</details>
<details>
<summary>You don't have to be Linus Torvalds</summary>

You don't have to invent Linux to contribute to OSS. In fact, the reason OSS is so powerful is that it is developed by millions of people, each doing a small part. We are more like bees, busying ourselves with our own little tasks, but together we make something beautiful.

3. Add your name to the list of contributors
4. Commit your changes
5. Push your changes to your fork
6. Open a Pull Request
7. Meet the requirements of the project, as defined by the maintainer
8. Have your Pull Request merged
</details>

<details>
<summary>Step 2: Contribute to a non-CYF OSS project</summary>

1. Find an Open Source project that you can make a useful contribution to
2. A good place to start is [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
3. Fork the project and make a contribution. It might be documentation, it might be code, it might be a bug fix, it might be a feature request. It doesn't matter. Just make a useful contribution.
4. Remember, you are a developer. You can contribute to any project, not just CYF projects. Represent us with honour.
